## End-to-End Machine Learning Project: Predicting Olympic Medal Counts

**Overview:**  
This project demonstrates the development of a machine learning model to predict a country’s medal count in the Olympic Games. The end-to-end process includes data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

**Highlights:**
- **Data Acquisition:** Gathered comprehensive historical data on Olympic Games, including country participation and medal statistics.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and engineering new features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed analysis and visualizations to explore data patterns and relationships.
- **Model Building:** Developed and tested multiple machine learning models, including linear regression and decision trees, using Python and Scikit-Learn.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed model performance with metrics such as RMSE and R², selecting the most accurate model.
- **Model Optimization:** Fine-tuned the model with hyperparameter optimization to improve predictions.

**Tools and Technologies:**
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
