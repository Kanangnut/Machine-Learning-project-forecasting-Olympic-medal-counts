# End-to-End Machine Learning Project Using Python and Jupyter Notebook

**Objective:**  
The goal of this project is to predict a country's Olympic medal count using machine learning techniques.

**Key Components:**
1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Acquired historical data on Olympic Games, including country participation, medal counts, and other relevant metrics.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Cleaned and transformed the raw data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
   - Feature engineering to create new variables that could improve model performance.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Conducted visualizations to understand data distribution and correlations between features.
   - Identified key factors that might influence a country’s medal count.

4. **Model Building:**  
   - Implemented various machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
   - Used Python libraries like Scikit-Learn for model training and evaluation.

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Compared model performance using metrics MSE.
   - Selected the best-performing model for predicting the medal count.

6. **Model Optimization:**  
   - Fine-tuned the model using hyperparameter optimization techniques.
   - Ensured that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

7. **Results and Insights:**  
   - Presented the final model's predictions and provided insights into the factors that most influence a country’s Olympic success.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

**Outcome:**  
- Developed a reliable predictive model that can help stakeholders understand and anticipate a country's potential performance in future Olympic Games.
